# Restaurant Management System

<b>Marmara University / CSE3055 - Database Systems (2021)</b>

<b>Project</b>

<p>In this project, we created a database using MSSQL for the business tracking of restaurants. We have facilitated the use of the database by using Views, Triggers and Stored Procedures in it. Finally, we made a Web Interface so that the user can manage the database.</p>
